                       Angular-based web application that calculates distances based on inputs.

                       The inputs describe an IP address and the distance calculated is how far a typist using 1 finger per hand would move their fingers to type the IP address.

                       Google Web Toolkit-based single page web application that allows an administrator to conduct a tournament for the online game League of Legends.

                     <li>
                        This application was developed after attending a tournament at a Microsoft store and seeing how the tournament was managed. The lack of any tools for this purpose inspired me to create something and learn a new framework in the process. Unfortunately, the Microsoft store stopped the tournaments before the application was finished so it was never used in the field.

                     <li>
                        The application interacts with the game's API to dynamically pull in game data.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       The application allows all players to be entered into a general pool and then teams are created based on player experience. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       Once teams are created, a round-robin-style tournament takes place where the administrator can select the winner and loser for each match and see the teams advance along the tournament tree.

                         Math Dice is a game where you use dice and number combinations to score. It's a neat way for kids to get mathematical dexterity. In the game, you first roll the 12-sided Target Die to get your target number, then roll the five 6-sided Scoring Dice. Using addition and/or subtraction, combine the Scoring Dice to match the target number. The number of dice you used to achieve the target number is your score for that round.

                       A recurrence relation is a mathematical construct for defining a series of numbers. It works by first giving an initial term, and then recursively defining the rest of the series as functions of the first one.
