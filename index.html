                       Angular-based web application that calculates distances based on inputs.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       The inputs describe an IP address and the distance calculated is how far a typist using 1 finger per hand would move their fingers to type the IP address.

                     <li>
                       Google Web Toolkit-based single page web application that allows an administrator to conduct a tournament for the online game League of Legends.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        This application was developed after attending a tournament at a Microsoft store and seeing how the tournament was managed. The lack of any tools for this purpose inspired me to create something and learn a new framework in the process. Unfortunately, the Microsoft store stopped the tournaments before the application was finished so it was never used in the field.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The application interacts with the game's API to dynamically pull in game data.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       The application allows all players to be entered into a general pool and then teams are created based on player experience. 
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       Once teams are created, a round-robin-style tournament takes place where the administrator can select the winner and loser for each match and see the teams advance along the tournament tree.

                       This program adds an arbitrary number of fractions in the form A/B. The least common multiple is found and then the fractions are converted to the same denominator-base.
